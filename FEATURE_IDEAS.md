# Feature Ideas

Track potential enhancements here. Add notes, tradeoffs, or links as needed.

## Candidate ideas

- CLI flags for `--config` and `--schema` to run from any directory
- Validation: layer-aware checks and grouped reporting
- CLI output formats: `--json` or `--format` for scripting
- Deduplicate relationships at query time (optionally with a flag)
- Import/export tools (dump entity/relationship summaries)
- Project scaffolding: richer templates and a `--path` option for `lorecraft init`
- MCP: expose validation report details via a tool
- Performance: batch relationship upserts for large datasets
